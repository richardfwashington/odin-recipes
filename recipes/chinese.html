  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>It's chicken, but with a chinese flavour.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>3 tbsp clear honey</li>
    <li>3 tbsp light soy sauce</li>
    <li>½ tbsp finely grated ginger</li>
    <li>2 garlic cloves, crushed</li>
    <li>½ tsp Chinese five spice</li>
    <li>1kg chicken drumsticks</li>
    <li>4 nests medium egg noodles</li>
    <li>50g spring onions, finely sliced</li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
   <li>Heat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C. Whisk the honey, soy, ginger, garlic and Chinese five spice with 3 tbsp water in a large bowl, then add the chicken drumsticks and toss together well. Tip into a roasting tray where the chicken fits snugly (to prevent excess marinade burning). Roast for 35-40 mins (turning halfway through) until the chicken is cooked through, and they are sticky and glossy.</li>
   <li>When the chicken drumsticks have 5 mins left, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, and cook the noodles for 3-4 mins until tender. Drain well and serve with the chicken, scattering with spring onions to serve.</li>
