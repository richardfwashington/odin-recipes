  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>The old classic.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li> tbsp olive oil</li>
      <li>250g pack Tesco lean beef steak mince 5% fat</li>
      <li>½ red onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>1 carrot, grated</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
      <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>6 sheets fresh lasagne</li>
      <li>½ x 340g jar white lasagne sauce</li>
      <li>200g grated mozzarella</li>
      <li>227g tin chopped tomatoes</li>
      <li>12 fresh basil leaves, to garnish</li>
  </ul> 
  <h2>Steps</h2>
    <li>Heat a large frying pan with the olive oil. Fry the beef mince on a high heat until browned. Add the onion, carrot and garlic and cook for a further 1 min. Lower the heat and add the chopped tomatoes. Stir well, then remove from heat and allow to cool.</li>
    <li>Cook the pasta sheets one by one in a large pan of boiling water for around 30 seconds. Drain on a clean tea towel.</li>
    <li>Overlap two sheets of lasagne along the short edge and stick together using a little white lasagne sauce. Do this with all 6 lasagne sheets so there are 3 long sheets to roll. Lightly spread with the remaining white sauce, dividing evenly between them and leaving 2cm at the top to seal once rolled. Divide the beef mince between the 3 long sheets and spread over the white sauce. Sprinkle over ¼ of the grated mozzarella.</li>
    <li>Starting at the short end that has been spread to the edge, tightly roll and use the 2cm border to seal. Place on a baking sheet, seal side down and transfer to the freezer to firm up for 15 minutes. Preheat the oven to gas 6, 200°C, fan 180°C.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile tip the remaining tinned tomatoes into a small pan and heat gently for 3-4 mins. Pour into a small gratin dish about 20cm x 25 cm or 20cm in diameter. Sprinkle over half the remaining cheese.</li>
    <li>After 15 mins, remove the lasagne rolls from the freezer and slice each one into three. Nestle into the gratin dish with the sauce and cover with foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 mins. Remove from oven and uncover. Fill the gaps between the rolls with grated mozzarella and bake, uncovered, for 20-25 mins, until the cheese is bubbling and the lasagne is cooked through.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh basil and serve with garlic bread if you like.</li>
